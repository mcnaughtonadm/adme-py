`adme-py` is a Python package that leverages open-source tools such as `rdkit` to generate *Absorption*, *Distribution*, *Metabolism*, and *Excretion* (and sometimes including *Toxicity*) summaries for molecules. 

It seeks to mimic the outputs provided by commonly-used tools such as [SwissADME](http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php) and [others](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9864198/) but is not restricted to a web application and can be imported or used through the command-line. This allows for nicer integration between other Python scripts.
